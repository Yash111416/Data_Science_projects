Data_Preprocessing_Pipeline


This is the repo for jupyter notebook / Google Collab project I created to handle data science and analytics problems with a prebuilt pipeline, workflow, and fully working code. Totally ready to import multiple data sources (MySQL, CSV, txt, XML, JSON...), preprocessing, processing, analyzing, and visualization capabilities. Modeling capabilities for machine learning and data science.
