# A/B Testing Analysis

## Introduction
This A/B testing analysis aims to compare the effectiveness of two marketing campaigns, referred to as the control campaign and the test campaign. We will utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization. Two datasets, `control_group.csv` and `test_group.csv`, will be used to conduct this analysis.

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- datetime
- plotly.graph_objects
- plotly.express
- plotly.io

## Dataset
- `control_group.csv`
- `test_group.csv`
  
## Methodology
1. **Data Loading:** Load the control and test group datasets using Pandas.
2. **Data Exploration:** Understand the structure and features of the datasets.
3. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
4. **A/B Testing:** Conduct statistical tests and visualizations to compare campaign performance.
5. **Conclusion:** Draw insights based on the A/B testing results.

## Conclusion
From the above A/B tests, we found that the control campaign resulted in more sales and higher engagement from visitors. The control campaign led to more products being viewed, added to the cart, and ultimately resulted in more sales. However, it's noteworthy that the conversion rate of products in the cart was higher in the test campaign. The test campaign was particularly effective in terms of sales concerning the products viewed and added to the cart.

In summary, the test campaign can be utilized to market specific products to a targeted audience due to its higher conversion rate. On the other hand, the control campaign can be employed to market multiple products to a broader audience, as it resulted in higher overall sales. The choice between campaigns depends on the marketing strategy â€“ whether focusing on specific products or reaching a wider customer base.
